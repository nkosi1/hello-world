# hello-world
putting my faith where it matters most
I actually thought they would change.
They did not like me one bit, and i thought i would change them
but i see i am Jesus default, I can only love. And they can't love because i am not of them
i conquered before i came.
hint: Jesus default is;
17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 18And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; KJV 2 Corin 5
